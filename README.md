- Based on the average temperatures, both June and December are sustainable for ice cream and surf business. Although, during December, surf might not be as popular since the min temperature is around 56 degrees.

## <u>Summary</u>
After analyzing weather data in Oahu, we can see that there is four-degree difference on the average and the standard deviation is very small. With these results, we can conclude that opening a surf & ice cream business is good idea. However, before deciding, it would be a good idea to determine the rain percentage, how long does the rain last, and wave conditions.
